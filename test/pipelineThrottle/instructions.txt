Hi. Welcome.
These are instructions for testing approval_processorMP's pipeline throttler.
The idea is to ignore events from specific group/pipeline/searches when 
specific pipelines are overproducing events.

What approval_processorMP will do upon receipt of a "new" type lvalert is
see if there is a PipelineThrottle QueueItem with the throttleKey formed
by the group/pipeline/search combination.

It will either add the event to an already existing PipelineThrottle or create
a new one and add it to the events tracker there.

From the child-Config-approval_processorMP.ini file, it will know what the
targetRate and window for tracking should be, and what the number threshold 
should be by computing this value. Depending on the value of requireManualReset,
the PipelineThrottle will forever remained throttled once throttled (requiring
using the command resetThrottle) or it will sort itself out and become 
unthrottled if we wait long enough and the pipeline calms down.

Thus to test, we need to start an lvalert_listenMP listener.
An example of that script is found in the file startApproval_ProcessorMP.sh
You need to edit it correspondingly --
    (1) Pay attention to where you put your .netrc file
    (2) Which server are you using? If you use lvalert.cgca.uwm.edu you are
        listening to events put into gracedb.ligo.org -- this means you 
        absolutely need to make sure you *only* test with group=Test events
        so as to not actually set off the true approval_processorMP which is
        running
        If you want to test with other types of triggers you need to set the
        server to lvalert-test.cgca.uwm.edu
    (3) Pay attention to the lvalert_listenMP.ini file -- open it up and make
        sure you only listen to the Test_() nodes if you are running on gracedb
        and also a node that is yours that you can publish to.
        Do *NOT* send commands to approval_processorMPcommands because that is
        the real commands node. You are only testing!
        You may have to create your own lvalert node for sending commands to
        that you are subscribed to, can publish to, and are listening to in 
        this .ini file.

Next, I will include a script that will generate triggers for the Test_CWB2G
node

The first part of the test will generate 3 triggers, but they will all have 
the same event gpstime, and therefore be counted as only 1 trigger by approval
processorMP. This is to ensure that none of these 3 triggers are labeled
as EM_Throttled since they are effectively the same trigger.

Next, the resetThrottle command will be sent to reset the PipelineThrottle.

Afterwards, 3 triggers will be sent again, but with distinct event gpstimes.
3 triggers is enough to trip the throttle and cause events to be labeled as 
EM_Throttled in gracedb. 

Again, afterwards, I will send an unthrottling command.
And then I will generate 1 last trigger and show it is not labeled EM_Throttled.

That is the test.

The results will be in the log file that you specify in the childConfig.ini's
log_directory under the [general] heading.

Good luck!
